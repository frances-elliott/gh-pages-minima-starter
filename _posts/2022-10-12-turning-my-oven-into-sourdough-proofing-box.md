So I make a nice sourdough half-wheat sandwich loaf in the summer with very little effort. I follow this recipe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQtsvPlE7w8, 
subbing in 2 oz of ripe sourdough starter for the yeast (which I rise overnight, and BTW, I never discard starter, just keep a tiny quantity in fridge), 
and doing a day-long rise on the counter with a couple gentle folds.

But I struggle in the winter. 

Conventional advice is "use your oven light or just buy a proofing box". I love to experiment and DIY rather than buy bulky equipment.
But my 15w oven light heats up the oven WAY too much for a good rise, I've found. 
All last winter, I experimented with ways to cool down the temperature -- propping open the door (nope, dough reacts badly to the changing temps introduced by 
the resulting "draft"), turning the light on or off periodically, or blocking the light with a ceramic bowl and oven mitt. none of these methods worked well.

Today I think I might have cracked it! I used a 5-watt LED bulb  (OK I forget how many lumen that is) attached to a lamp socket with cord like this one https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-2-Pack-Hanging-Lantern/dp/B07BLJH57Z 
and ... yes, I stuck the 
bulb into the oven, plugged into a nearby outlet. probably not super safe, but I did cover all the oven controls with a towel to prevent a fool (me)
from trying to turn the oven on. Then I put the dough on the bottom of the oven, and added a pizza stone on the middle shelf to shield the dough from
 the warmth of the bulb.
 
 I got a GREAT rise! really great! I may be onto something here...
