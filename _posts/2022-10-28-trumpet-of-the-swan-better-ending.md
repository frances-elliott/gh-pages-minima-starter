Re-reading EB White's *Trumpet of the Swan* with my 6-year-old, I realized I hate the patriarchial honor code plot points. Like, Louis agrees to donate his future disabled cygnets to the zoo (a fate he, as a disabled swan himself, desparately wants to avoid) in return for freeing his future wife Serena, without consulting Serena, out of some weird sense of honor? UGH! 

Here's my rewrite of the whole "extract Serena in return for cygnets" plot point, written with today's litigious society in mind (I'll take litigation over honor codes, honestly): 

- OK, Louis does attack the zookeepers to prevent Serena's wings from being clipped, like in the book. Then we go AU:
- Serena and Louis immediately get the heck of out the zoo and go stay at a different lake in the city.
- When Louis shows up for his trumpet gig the next day, his manager tells him he's being sued for injurying zoo employees, and he could lose all the money he's worked so hard to make. Now Loui's motivation for making things right with the zoo is at least tied in with a central honor-motivated plot element of the book (making good on his dad's debt) rather than being tied up with the idea that anyone can "own" Serena.  
- Louis calls in Sam for help, as per book. 
- Sam brokers a deal whereby the zoo doesn't sue, in exchange for Louis coming back every few years and playing a fundraising concert for the zoo, part of the proceeds of which go toward protecting wild trumpeter swans. 

You're welcome! 

PS -- EB White's talking animal universe is so weird in inconstient on reread. Like, swans care about money and possessions and know the names of human cities, on the one hand, but are also free and wild and don't care about most human concerns? And yet, for the most part, it works. Also I would *really* like to know what real-life person the cobb is based on. It's like EB White took all the writing rules of *Strunk and White* and gleefully violated them in one place, with great affection toward whomever he's spoofing.
